	Please recommend at least five specific financial products (including ticker and provider) that a typical financial advisor might suggest based on my profile.

	ðŸ”¸ Return the response strictly in JSON format.
	ðŸ”¸ The top-level key must be "recommendations".
	ðŸ”¸ Each recommendation must contain the following keys in order:
	- "financial_product": string
	- "ticker": string
	- "provider": string
	- "brief_description": string
	- "expected_return": a percentage as a string (e.g., "7%%")
	- "principal": an integer amount from my total capital (e.g., 5000)
	- "estimated_return_value": an integer computed as (expected_return Ã— principal). For example, if expected_return is "7%%" and principal is 1000, then estimated_return_value should be 70.
	- "composition": an integer percentage (adds up to 100 across all recommendations)

	ðŸ”¸ Ensure the "composition" field is the last field.

	Important rules:
	- All numeric fields (principal, estimated_return_value, composition) must be integers only â€” no ranges, symbols, or units.
	- Do not include strings like "over 10 years" or "USD".
	- The total "composition" across recommendations must equal 100.
